# Halcyon (MiMir) Wordpress theme
Wordpress theme created as part of Datadriven applications module during second year. This was first time run at creating a wordpress template for potentially a portfolio website. In the end scrapped due to not being fan of how wordpress handles creation of posts for portfolio. Goal is to use what learned here as far as UI goes in a React or Vuejs project.
